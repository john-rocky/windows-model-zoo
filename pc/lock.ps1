<#
The lane's timing lock from the Mac, one SSH call per action (the wait loops run here, not as polls from the Mac).

  lock.ps1 -Action take -What "<text>"      waits (5 s reads) until busy.txt is ours: prints TAKEN / OURS / STALE / TIMEOUT
                                            (<text> in the shared PC's form: "timing: <what> until HH:MM")
  lock.ps1 -Action gate                     the lane's quiet gate (zlib Pass-LaneGate): prints PASS / TIMEOUT
  lock.ps1 -Action release [-OpenSec <s>]   removes busy.txt if it is ours: prints RELEASED / NOT-OURS; with -OpenSec,
                                            pcup\window.txt says "<lane> open until <now + s>" (a gap the lane comes back from)
  lock.ps1 -Action status                   prints the marker, the active\ and yield\ notes
  lock.ps1 -Action slot -What "<who> <give up min>"   runs\slot_now.txt for the running timed chain (pc\chain.ps1):
                                            a slot for another lane at the user's word, no window.txt
  lock.ps1 -Action note -What "<text>"      pcup\active\<lane>.txt = "<text>" + "written HH:MM" (the lane waits for a window);
                                            -What "" removes it
take removes the lane's window.txt once the lock is ours; release without -OpenSec removes it too (the PC is free, no window).
